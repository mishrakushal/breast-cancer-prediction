# Breast Cancer Prediction Model
I made a logistic regression machine learning model which takes various inputs and predicts whether the person has breast cancer or not. <br>
- This model considers various cases and then is able to make predictions accurately upto ``98.67%`` times! <br>
- The accuracy was calculated using k-fold cross validation.
